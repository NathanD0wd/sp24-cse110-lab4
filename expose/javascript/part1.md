## Questions

1. 'values added: 20'
2. 'final result: 20'
3. 'values added: 20'
4. Error. result is defined as a let in the scope of the if statement, so accessing outside of this will cause an error.
5. An error will occur on line 7 when you try to reassign the const
6. Same as 5, but it is also outside the scope of the if statement
